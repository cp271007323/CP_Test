# TBActionSheet

TBActionSheet is a small library that allows you to substitute Apple's uncustomizable `UIActionSheet`, with a beautiful and totally customizable actionsheet that you can use in your iOS app. The default style is iOS9/10, you can make your own style. Enjoy!  

Here are some pictures showing TBActionSheet's powerful individuation. You can change UI dynamically:

## üîÆ Example

To run the example project, clone the repo and run MTDemo target.

## üí∞ Requirement

- iOS 7.0+ (iOS 8.0+ full features supported)
- Xcode 10.1+

## üì≤ Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate TBActionSheet into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:


```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!
target 'MyApp' do
	pod 'TBActionSheet'
end
```

You need replace "MyApp" with your project's name.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate TBActionSheet into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "yulingtianxia/TBActionSheet"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `TBActionSheetKit.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manual

Just drag the "Source" document folder into your project.

## üêí Usage

### TLDR

You can refer to 'ViewController.m' in the TBAlertControllerDemo project.The base usage is same as 'UIActionSheet'.

To let TBActionSheet looks like WeChat style, you can set these properties of `TBActionShet` or it's `UIAppearance` like this :

```
sheetWidth = MIN(kScreenWidth, kScreenHeight);
backgroundTransparentEnabled = NO;
rectCornerRadius = 0;
``` 

### More than what you want

The base usage is same to `UIActionSheet`. You can just replace `UIActionSheet` with `TBActionSheet`. If you want to customize your action sheet, just configure some properties. 

[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/yulingtianxia/TBActionSheet/wiki) can help you master advanced usage.

There is also an example project for `TBActionSheet`.

## TBAlertController

This repo also include `TBAlertController`, which unifies `UIAlertController`, `UIAlertView`, and `UIActionSheet`. `TBAlertController` will use `UIAlertController` on iOS 8.2 and later. On the contrary, it will use `UIAlertView` or `UIActionSheet`.

The API Usage of `TBAlertController` is similar to `UIAlertController`. I also provide `TBAlertAction` instead of `UIAlertAction`.

There is an example:

```
TBAlertController *controller = [TBAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:@"TBAlertController" message:@"AlertStyle" preferredStyle:TBAlertControllerStyleAlert];
TBAlertAction *clickme = [TBAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"ÁÇπÊàë" style: TBAlertActionStyleDefault handler:^(TBAlertAction * _Nonnull action) {
    NSLog(@"%@",action.title);
}];
TBAlertAction *cancel = [TBAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"ÂèñÊ∂à" style: TBAlertActionStyleCancel handler:^(TBAlertAction * _Nonnull action) {
    NSLog(@"%@",action.title);
}];
[controller addAction:clickme];
[controller addAction:cancel];
[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
```
